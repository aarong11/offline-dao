# 📊 AI Usage, Equity & Environmental Impact Tracking Proposal

## 🧭 Purpose

This document proposes that **all AI-assisted projects** within our ecosystem begin including automated tracking of:

* 💸 **Cost savings** (human time, wages, consulting, infrastructure)
* 🌍 **Environmental savings** (energy use, CO₂ emissions)
* ⏱ **Time compression** (how long tasks would’ve taken without AI)
* 🧠 **Qualitative impact** (e.g., safety, empowerment, access, reach)
* ⚠️ **Inefficiency flags** (where human input would have been faster, cheaper, or more secure)
* 🫂 **Equity assurance** (ensure contributors are supported through UBI or baseline funding)
* 📈 **Social guarantees** (pensions, job continuity, and retraining for those displaced or who contribute to AI training — intentionally or not)

## 🧠 Mission Statement

We believe that:

* AI should **amplify, not displace** human dignity.
* Every person who trains, steers, or contributes to AI systems — whether **explicitly** (via datasets, prompts, testing) or **implicitly** (as artists, workers, or speakers whose knowledge is modeled) — deserves recognition and support.
* Projects that benefit from automation must **redistribute that benefit** — through:

  * 🫂 **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** for contributors
  * 🏦 **Pensions and job continuity** for those displaced by AI
  * 🧑‍🏫 **Retraining and upskilling** opportunities for long-term empowerment

We don’t just want ethical AI systems — we want **ethical ecosystems** where AI-augmented labor is safe, compensated, and future-proofed.

## 🔍 Why It Matters

As AI becomes integral to our workflows, it's easy to overlook the invisible efficiencies — and to miss the accountability opportunities. But it’s just as important to track where AI is the **wrong tool**, causing:

* 🚫 Redundancy or unnecessary complexity
* 🔐 Avoidable security or trust risks
* 💸 Waste of resources where simpler tools or humans would suffice

And it's even more critical to ensure that:

* 🫂 **Contributors are not displaced, but supported**
* 💖 **People using these workflows have baseline financial stability**
* 💼 **UBI, pensions, or retraining are guaranteed** for participation in public-good or AI-training-related labor

By logging both positive and negative impact metrics, we:

* ✅ Demonstrate *measurable public benefit*
* ✅ Enable *climate- and ethics-aware innovation*
* ✅ Build trust in AI-augmented workflows
* ✅ Help funding bodies and governments understand ROI
* ⚖️ Identify *critical handoffs where human judgment or domain knowledge is superior*
* 🫂 Ensure participants are *not punished for working efficiently with AI*, but rewarded and supported

## 🛠 Proposed Implementation

### 1. **Token-Based Tracking Module**

Every CLI- or script-based tool should:

* Count tokens or estimate message lengths
* Map token usage to energy (kWh) using per-model baselines
* Convert energy to CO₂ (regionally adjustable)
* Optionally convert tokens to equivalent human labor hours or freelance cost
* Log instances where AI was **slower, less accurate, or more costly** than expected

### 2. **Session Metadata Export**

Each project can optionally export:

```json
{
  "tokens_used": 148200,
  "estimated_energy_kwh": 0.089,
  "co2_grams_emitted": 35.6,
  "cost_equivalent_usd": 2.49,
  "time_saved_estimate_hours": 18,
  "ai_vs_human_efficiency": "AI was slower than expected for dependency resolution",
  "impact_notes": ["Prototype generated in 24 hours vs 8-week baseline"],
  "ubi_credit": 40,
  "pension_eligible": true,
  "retraining_flagged": false
}
```

### 3. **CLI Hooks**

For tools like `dao.py`, we can auto-log per command:

* Tokens processed
* Cost/environmental savings
* Cumulative footprint vs baseline
* Flags where AI failed to outperform human-equivalent task
* UBI credits awarded to contributors based on verified participation or effort
* Trigger pension credit and retraining suggestions for displaced or high-risk roles

### 4. **Reporting & Badges**

Projects can show public badges:

> ✅ *"This toolkit saved \~91% CO₂ compared to traditional workflows."*
> ⚠️ *"Dependency mapping took longer than expected using AI alone. Human input advised for similar tasks."*
> 🫂 *"Contributor supported with UBI credit for meaningful public-good participation."*
> 🏦 *"Training participation logged. Pension and retraining credits applied."*

## 🧮 Default Model Energy Estimates (Adjustable)

| Model      | kWh / 1M tokens | Notes                       |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| GPT-4o     | 0.6             | Advanced multimodal         |
| GPT-3.5    | 0.3             | Lightweight                 |
| LLaMA-3-8B | 0.1             | Efficient local inferencing |

## 🔄 Next Steps

---

Let’s quantify what ethical, efficient AI can look like — not just in theory, but in every log file.
Let’s also be honest about when the best solution isn’t AI — and make space for human judgment where it outperforms.

Most importantly, let’s make sure **no one is left behind** for working efficiently, ethically, or anonymously —
**support through UBI, pensions, and retraining is critical to sustainable participation in the AI era.**

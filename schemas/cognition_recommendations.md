# Cognitive Schema Recommendations

This document provides recommendations for implementation, extension, and ethical considerations for the cognitive schema system.

## Modularization Recommendations

1. **Versioning Strategy**
   - Implement semantic versioning for all schemas
   - Consider how to migrate data as schemas evolve
   - Document backwards compatibility guarantees

2. **Additional Abstraction Opportunities**
   - Consider extracting more common patterns into reusable schemas
   - Develop specialized schemas for different memory types (episodic vs. semantic)
   - Create context-specific schemas for different domains (work/personal/research)

3. **Integration with Existing DAO Systems**
   - Link cognitive states to specific project tasks and milestones
   - Consider integration with the epoch logging system for temporal anchoring
   - Enable selective disclosure of psychological states to project leads when relevant

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Storage and Retrieval**
   - Consider a hybrid storage approach:
     - Core metadata and cryptographic information in a blockchain or distributed ledger
     - Content and context information in a secure off-chain storage system
     - Vector embeddings in a specialized vector database for efficient similarity search
   - Design system to support both online and offline operations
   - Implement efficient retrieval by multiple dimensions (time, context, importance)

2. **Performance and Scaling**
   - Memory chains will grow very large over time - implement efficient pruning and summarization
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed records
   - Implement pagination and partial record retrieval to handle large memory sets

3. **Privacy and Security**
   - Design access control to limit visibility of personal records
   - Implement encryption for sensitive fields (beyond the basic signature verification)
   - Consider zero-knowledge proof approaches for verifying records without revealing contents

## Philosophical and Ethical Considerations

1. **Memory Malleability**
   - Acknowledge that human memories change over time
   - Consider implementing a "revision history" for memories that preserves the original record
   - Allow confidence to be updated without changing the core memory content
   - Add metadata to track memory "hardening" through repeated recall or corroboration

2. **Psychological Safety**
   - Design system to avoid reinforcing negative patterns or states
   - Consider implementing circuit breakers or alerts for concerning psychological patterns
   - Develop mechanisms to flag manipulative gaslighting attempts
   - Ensure the system respects cognitive load and doesn't become burdensome

3. **Identity and Personhood**
   - Respect that a person is more than the sum of their recorded states
   - Avoid reducing human complexity to numerical metrics
   - Support flexible identity boundaries (selective disclosure)
   - Protect against identity fusion or confusion across different humans

4. **Cognitive Diversity**
   - Ensure scales and metrics are appropriate for neurodiverse individuals
   - Allow customization of confidence and importance scales
   - Support different cognitive processing styles and memory organization approaches
   - Avoid normative judgments about what constitutes "good" cognition

## Privacy Protections

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Store only what's necessary for the purpose
   - Implement granular sharing controls
   - Support selective erasure of specific memories or emotional records
   - Consider time-bound data retention policies

2. **Informed Consent**
   - Develop clear explanations of how data is used
   - Implement progressive disclosure of tracking capabilities
   - Ensure users can withdraw consent and export/delete their data
   - Support temporary opt-out for sensitive periods

3. **Adversarial Resilience**
   - Design with awareness of potential misuse scenarios
   - Protect against gaslighting and manipulation attempts
   - Implement tamper detection for memory chains
   - Consider anti-coercion mechanisms (duress codes)

## Potential Extensions

1. **Group Memory Structures**
   - Develop schemas for shared memories across multiple humans
   - Implement consensus mechanisms for corroboration
   - Support different confidence levels across different witnesses

2. **AI Integration**
   - Extend schemas to support AI-generated insights or correlations
   - Clearly mark AI-suggested versus human-recorded memories
   - Develop safeguards against false memory implantation

3. **External Verification**
   - Create schemas for linking memories to external evidence
   - Support multi-party verification of shared experiences
   - Develop consensus mechanisms for disputed memories

4. **Context Recovery Tools**
   - Design interfaces specifically for memory recall assistance
   - Develop "memory recovery" workflows with appropriate safeguards
   - Create contextual prompting systems that respect privacy and integrity
